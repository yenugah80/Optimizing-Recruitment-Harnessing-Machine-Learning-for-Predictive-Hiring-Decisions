## Optimizing Recruitment: Harnessing Machine Learning for Predictive Hiring Decisions

## Project Description
This project explores the use of machine learning models to optimize recruitment by predicting hiring decisions based on candidate profiles. The aim is to streamline recruitment by using models such as CatBoost, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict whether a candidate will be hired.

Dataset
The dataset contains 1,500 candidate profiles with features such as:
Age
Gender
Education Level
Experience Years
Skill and Personality Scores
Hiring Decision

Key Models Used
CatBoost
Random Forest
XGBoost

Results
CatBoost outperformed other models with an accuracy of 96%.
